Hello

This is my task done in a different way

I decided to do the same task 2 times because I didn't know many things that were required in the task for the first time. For example, I didn't know how to use CRUD Redux saga or redux thunk. wasted too much time so I decided to do them in the end if I succeed.In the end I managed but the only way I managed is not elegant.I also made a lot of mistakes in the react structure

During this project I used the CRUD technique which I did not use during the first project. I made a lot of visual changes that seemed better to me. I implemented the Load More functionality better. I also implemented the Edit functionality.
I replaced the fetch with axios,
implemented a dropdown interaction

Get this project by cloning this repository on your device.

When repository is cloned navigate to folder MoPTask2.

Install node modules by runing command npm install inside of terminal  // terminal must be open at top level inside of MoPproject folder.

run json server by runing command    json-server --watch data/db.json --port 5000     in terminal at top level

Run code with using npm start command inside of terminal at top level.

I had a problem with the json server I would often stop watching db.json . if the page doesn't work as it should, see if the json server is still turned on.
